## Summary of Project
For this project, we practiced building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After we transformed the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

A Crowdfunding database made up of 4 tables. The tables are categories, subcategories, contacts, and campaigns. The campaign table includes category, subcategory, and contact id's to reference to those tables. We used python to extract and clean our data in order to load it into our database. Four Pandas DataFrames were created and exported to csv's.
